The variables and coefficients that provided a non-random amount of variance to the linear model include the intercept, vehicle length, and ground clearance. 

The resultant slope is non-zero and is indicated by the r-squared value of 0.7149 for the multiple regression. This outperforms the adjusted r-squared which is 0.6825.

This linear model does predict the mpg of Mecha-Car models effectively because the resultant r-squared value has a p-value of 5.35e-11 which is statistically significant.
